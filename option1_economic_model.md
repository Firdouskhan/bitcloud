The Economics of Bitcloud and CloudTokens
By Kyle Torpey

Note: I've added a glossary to the end of this paper because it includes words I made up for the Bitcloud network.

The Creation of CloudTokens

100 CloudTokens are created every ten minutes by the various nodes storing content on the Bitcloud network. Each node's share of CloudTokens is determined by the node's overall share of the network's bandwidth during that ten minute window. A node's share of each block reward can be found with the following simple equation:

bandwidth shared by node/total Bitcloud network bandwidth = x/100

Creating Demand for CloudTokens and Optimizing the Network

The services of the Bitcloud network will create demand for CloudTokens. If people couldn't do anything with CloudTokens, there would be no reason to buy them. They do not have the same advantage as Bitcoin when it comes to being the first cryptocurrency on the market. This means that CloudTokens are actually a commodity more than anything else. People may end up using them as money, but, at the end of the day, they are a commodity that can be turned into something else. They are like the gas you put in your car. These CloudTokens are also used to pay the nodes who are sharing content to all of the Bitcloud end users, so it's important to make sure these nodes are getting paid with something valuable for their work.

We can prove the value of CloudTokens by explaining one service of the Bitcloud network: advertising on content. To advertise on WeTube videos, an advertiser must purchase CloudTokens and then send a special transaction into the blockchain. The transaction consists of the actual CloudTokens, an image/string of text/video to display on the content, and the ID of the nodepool where the ad should be displayed. When that transaction is sent, the CloudTokens are destroyed and the ad is placed at the end of a list of ads on the selected node pool (perhaps they could even pay extra to move to the top of the list).

So where did the advertiser get the CloudTokens in the first place? He likely purchased them from a CloudTokens exchange for bitcoins or another currency. He thought about the number of people who watch videos on WeTube, and he decided that the market rate for CloudTokens would allow him to get a fair deal. It's also possible that node pools would setup their own platforms where advertisers would be able to purchase ad space directly for bitcoins. This would make the process much easier for advertisers because they wouldn't have to worry about market rates or converting from bitcoins to CloudTokens. All the advertiser would see is a website that sold ad space on particular node pools for bitcoins. In the back end, those bitcoins would be converted to CloudTokens and the transaction would be sent into the network. This is another reason that I think CloudTokens will be more of a commodity than a currency. It's possible that end users won't even interact with them. The advertisers will bid up the price of CloudTokens when they feel like the low price of CloudTokens will allow them to get a great deal for an advertisement on WeTube. When they feel like the price of CloudTokens will cause advertisements to not be worth the cost, the price of CloudTokens will start to come back down.

Effects on the Network

The reason that the demand for CloudTokens is so important is that it also affects the stability of the entire network. An increase of users on the Bitcloud network sets off a chain reaction. Since more users are on the network, more bandwidth is needed to serve those users. The good news is that an increased user base also means increased ad space. More ad purchases will be made by advertisers, which increases the value of each CloudToken. Since the price of CloudTokens has gone up, more nodes will join the network because it is now profitable for them to share bandwidth.

Setting the Price of Advertisements and Other Services

Prices for services, such as advertising space, on the Bitcloud network are fixed. There are different rates for different niches, ad format (video, banner, text, etc.), and other attributes. A vote is held every month for changes to these rates in the protocol. Advertisements are one example, but there will be many different services provided by Bitcloud. Each service will have its own price, and those prices can be changed through cloudholder voting. Some will say that it would be better to allow node pools to choose their own prices, but the problem is then you would have a situation where the system is too decentralized. When you centralize as many apps as possible onto the same network, it adds value to that network. Breaking up into different networks would mean each node pool would have its own cryptocurrency. This means the system is not all monetized together, which hurts rewards for early adopters and general adoption of the Bitcloud network. Holding cloudholder votes on changes to the costs of different Bitcloud services is not ideal, but it is better than the alternatives.

Voting for Changes in the Decentralized Application

If you own CloudTokens, then you are a cloudholder. Each CloudToken is equal to one vote on changes to the Bitcloud protocol. There will be some continual (monthly, annually, etc.) votes built into the Bitcloud protocol, while other votes can be started through petition action by cloudholders. Votes from cloudholders who abstain from voting will not be counted. This gives us a way to make changes or improvements to the protocol in the future without having to centralize power in the hands of the original developers.

Glossary

cloudtokens – The currency of Bitcloud. This is what nodes are rewarded with when they share content for others. This is also what is used to purchase the services offered by Bitcloud.

CloudHolders – People who hold cloudtokens and have a right to vote on changes to the protocol.

WeTube – The first app for Bitcloud. It's a decentralized version of YouTube.

Node Pools – A collection of nodes who all share the same content. These pools are basically the channels or categories of WeTube.
