We are in the early stages of developing a protocol that will change the world forever.
We are calling it Bitcloud, to separate it from Wetube, which is the interface. The main important features are:

- We are generating money from bandwidth sharing instead of mining!
- We introduce optional moderators to make the content of our net of very high quality (anyone can become a moderator).
- We optionally protect the IP and identity of the users and nodes that share delicate content
- And we have a blockchain, too! But quite different from actual ones.
- We don't initially own 100% of the coins like in Mastercoin or Next


**YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH US IN THIS VERY EARLY PROCESS AND BECOME PART OF THE  TEAM DOING THE MAIN DECISIONS.**

In contrast to what Invictus and Mastercoin is doing (centralizing development
and investment), I want, as an experiment, to make this process REALLY open,
allowing anyone who wants to participate to share his or her opinion.

Please, do pull request at will and talk in the forum and/or IRC.

We are contacting developers and thinkers only now, as we don't want this project to become mainstream until we have something to really work in and a good bunch of developers.
Please, spread the word between developers, marketers, thinkers, and similar people. There is no way that 1, 2 or 5 people can do this big project alone. We must go together.

Contact us at #bitcloud (general talk) and #bitcloud-dev (development talk)  at
freenode.
